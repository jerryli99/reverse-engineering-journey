This folder aims to let me peek how the assembly code looks like if I use design patterns like SOLID.

I am really curious to learn  more about how things work under the hood. May report my findings to you later. Now just write some code here. Analysis later.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP);

Open/Closed Princilpe (OCP);

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP);

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP);

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP);
